# Music Library Index

Given track metadata objects, constructs a searchable object model.
This module is used both in the client and the server of
[Groove Basin](https://github.com/superjoe30/groovebasin).

## Features

 * Sort order ignores 'a', 'an' and 'the' in artists, albums, and names.
 * Sorting and searching is case insensitive and
   [diacritics-insensitive](https://github.com/superjoe30/diacritics).
 * Searching uses word-based filtering (this is how most music player
   applications implement filtering) on all track fields.
 * Distinguishes albums by name, date, and album artist.
 * Produces these indexes:
   * Artists in sorted order
     - For each of these artists, albums in sorted order.
       - For each of these albums, tracks in sorted order.
   * Albums in sorted order
     - For each of these albums, tracks in sorted order.
   * Tracks by user-defined key.
   * Artists by library-defined key.
   * Albums by library-defined key.
